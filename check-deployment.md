## Vercel Deployment

### Project Configuration
- **Project ID**: prj_5XZnLYBJ91uvGA2AJHOe5iglk13x
- **Organization**: team_tsO9g7rPWL8Xo03DzlZVovZT
- **Project Name**: ectracc-fresh
- **Domain**: ectracc.com

### Vercel GitHub Integration
Based on the previous successful deployment and the `.vercel` folder configuration, your Vercel project should be configured for automatic deployments from GitHub.

**How to verify:**
1. Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find "ectracc-fresh" project
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for recent deployment triggered by commits:
   - cd25b6c (Dashboard fix - main)
   - 1687524 (Deployment trigger)
   - 75d860f (Documentation)

### Manual Deployment (If Needed)

If automatic deployment is not working, you need to authenticate with Vercel:

```bash
# The authentication URL from earlier:
https://vercel.com/oauth/device?user_code=NZKJ-XHGB

# Or run:
vercel login
# Then after auth:
vercel --prod
```

### Alternative: Vercel Deploy Hook

If you have a deploy hook URL (from Vercel settings), you can trigger deployment:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/[your-hook-id]
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Look for automatic deployments from the recent commits
   
2. **If no auto-deployment**, complete Vercel login:
   - Visit the OAuth URL above
   - Or use: `vercel login` → `vercel --prod`

3. **Verify on ectracc.com**:
   - After deployment shows "Ready" status
   - Test dashboard with "DAY" filter
   - Confirm message changes work correctly

## Changes Deployed
✅ Dashboard empty state messages now distinguish between:
- New users: "You haven't tracked any products yet"
- Existing users: "You haven't tracked any products [today/this week/etc]"
