### Bug Fixes and Resolutions

#### TypeScript Issues Resolved
1. **framer-motion Import Error**
   - **Issue**: `Cannot find module 'framer-motion'`
   - **Fix**: Added framer-motion to dependencies and installed properly
   - **Files**: Multiple component files using animations

2. **MUI Icon Props Error**
   - **Issue**: `Property 'sx' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes'`
   - **Fix**: Wrapped icons in Box component for proper styling
   - **Files**: `src/components/layout/EnhancedBottomTabs.tsx`
