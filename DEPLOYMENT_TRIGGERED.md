  - YTD/YEAR: "You haven't tracked any products **this year**"

### Monitoring Deployment

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Look for "ectracc-fresh" project
   - Check "Deployments" tab
   - Should see deployment for commit f6fd288 or cd25b6c

2. **Expected Timeline**:
   - GitHub webhook triggers: ~10-30 seconds
   - Vercel build starts: immediately after trigger
   - Build time: 2-4 minutes
   - Deployment: 30-60 seconds
   - **Total**: ~3-5 minutes

3. **Deployment Status**:
   - üîÑ Building (gray/yellow)
   - ‚úÖ Ready (green) - Deployment successful
   - ‚ùå Error (red) - Check logs

### Verification Steps

Once deployment shows "Ready" status on Vercel:

1. **Visit**: https://ectracc.com/dashboard
2. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
3. **Test the fix**:
   - Click "DAY" filter
   - If you have historical products but none today:
     - ‚úÖ Should say: "You haven't tracked any products **today**"
     - ‚ùå Should NOT say: "You haven't tracked any products yet"
   - Try other filters (WEEK, MONTH, YTD, YEAR)
   - Verify message updates for each time period

4. **Test with new user**:
   - Create test account with no data
   - Should see: "You haven't tracked any products yet"

### Troubleshooting

**If deployment doesn't start within 2 minutes:**
1. Check Vercel dashboard for webhook configuration
2. Verify GitHub integration is properly connected
3. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Build was tested successfully locally ‚úÖ

**If changes don't appear on ectracc.com:**
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for CDN propagation
3. Check deployment is marked as "Production" (not preview)

### Environment Configuration

```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=your-backend-url
