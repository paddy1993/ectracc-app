## Git Commits

### Main Feature Commit
**Commit**: `cd25b6c`
```
Fix dashboard empty state messages to distinguish between new and existing users

- Add all-time summary fetch to check if user has ever tracked products
- Show context-aware messages based on time filter (today/this week/this month/this year)
- New users see 'You haven't tracked any products yet'
- Existing users see 'You haven't tracked any products [time period]'
- Applied fix to both DashboardPage and DashboardPageEnhanced
- No performance impact - summaries fetched in parallel
```

### Deployment Trigger Commit
**Commit**: `1687524`
```
chore: Trigger Vercel deployment for dashboard fix
```

Both commits successfully pushed to `origin/main`.

### How to Verify Deployment

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Look for "ectracc-fresh" project
   - Check recent deployments for commits cd25b6c or 1687524
   - Wait for "Ready" status

2. **Check ectracc.com:**
   - Visit: https://ectracc.com/dashboard
   - Test the empty state messages:
     - Click "DAY" filter
     - Check if message says "today" (if you have prior entries but none today)
     - Or "yet" (if you're a new user with no entries)

## What Was Fixed

### Before
- User with historical data clicks "DAY" filter
- Sees: "You haven't tracked any products yet"
- ❌ Incorrect - implies they never tracked anything

### After
- User with historical data clicks "DAY" filter
- Sees: "You haven't tracked any products **today**"
- ✅ Correct - indicates they just haven't tracked anything in current period

### Message Variations by Time Filter
- **DAY**: "You haven't tracked any products **today**"
- **WEEK**: "You haven't tracked any products **this week**"
- **MONTH**: "You haven't tracked any products **this month**"
- **YTD/YEAR**: "You haven't tracked any products **this year**"
- **New User**: "You haven't tracked any products **yet**"
