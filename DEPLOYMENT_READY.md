### Deployment to Vercel

The code has been successfully pushed to GitHub (main branch). 

**Next Steps for Deployment:**

Since Vercel CLI requires authentication, there are two options:

#### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended if configured)
If your Vercel project is connected to GitHub with automatic deployments:
- Vercel should automatically detect the push to main branch
- It will trigger a production deployment automatically
- Check https://vercel.com/dashboard for deployment status
- Changes should appear on ectracc.com within 2-5 minutes

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find the "ectracc-fresh" project
3. Click on the latest deployment or "Deploy" button
4. Select the main branch
5. Confirm deployment

#### Option 3: Manual CLI Deployment
If you need to deploy via CLI:
```bash
cd /Users/patrickahern/ectracc-fresh
vercel login  # Login first if needed
vercel --prod
```

### Verification Steps

Once deployed, verify the fix at https://ectracc.com:

1. **Test with New User Account:**
   - Create new account or use test account with no data
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Click "DAY" filter
   - Should see: "You haven't tracked any products yet..."

2. **Test with Existing User:**
   - Use account with historical product entries
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Click "DAY" (assuming no products today)
   - Should see: "You haven't tracked any products today..."
   - Try "WEEK", "MONTH", etc. - messages should update accordingly

3. **Test with Current Period Data:**
   - Add a product entry
   - Dashboard should show normal stats (no empty state)

✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No linting errors
