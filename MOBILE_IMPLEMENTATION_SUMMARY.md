## üí∞ Costs Summary

| Item | Cost | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Apple Developer | $99/year | Need to purchase |
| Google Play | $25 one-time | Need to purchase |
| Expo EAS (optional) | $0-99/month | Using free tier |
| Backend | $0 | Already deployed |
| Supabase | $0 | Free tier |
| **Total** | **$124 + $99/year** | |

## üéØ Bug Fixing Across 3 Platforms

### The Good News
**Will NOT be significantly harder** because:

1. **75% shared code** = fix once, works everywhere
2. **Platform abstraction** isolates native issues
3. **TypeScript** catches errors at compile time
4. **Automated testing** prevents regressions
5. **Shared services** ensure API consistency

### The Reality Check
**Some complexity added**:

1. **Testing surface**: 3x the platforms to test
2. **Release cycles**: App store review takes 1-7 days (vs instant web deploy)
3. **Version fragmentation**: Users on different app versions
4. **Platform-specific bugs**: Native features may behave differently

### Mitigation Strategy ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- ‚úÖ Monorepo with shared packages
- ‚úÖ Platform abstraction layer
- ‚úÖ TypeScript for type safety
- ‚è≥ Comprehensive testing (Phase 5)
- ‚è≥ Automated CI/CD (Phase 6)
- ‚è≥ Crash monitoring (Phase 8)
